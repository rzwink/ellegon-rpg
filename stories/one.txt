The Cupbearer of Ashenlight

Refrain (radif): before the dawn

The gods had been silent so long that even prayer forgot its own words
Yet the cupbearer smiled and poured, saying truth wakes before the dawn

In the city of Ashenlight, where dragon banners once burned the sky,
Stone temples leaned like tired elders, waiting before the dawn

Aurelion the Blue had ruled these roads with fire and iron decree,
But even dragons must sleep, and all debts stir before the dawn

I was no hero, only a watcher of doors and broken vows,
Keeping ledgers of loss and hope unpaid before the dawn

One night the tavern lamp glowed brighter than sense allows,
And the cupbearer beckoned me softly, laughing before the dawn

His wine was not wine, though it stained the lips of fear,
It tasted of courage misplaced, then found before the dawn

He spoke of a Beloved not bound to flesh or crown,
A promise the world forgot how to keep before the dawn

I asked, Where were you when dragons burned the fields?
He said, In every hand that did not burn before the dawn

Outside, the earth trembled. Aurelion rose again,
His wings cutting stars into wounds before the dawn

The priests hid. The soldiers prayed to steel.
The cupbearer only refilled the cup before the dawn

Drink, he said, not to forget, but to remember rightly,
For fear is sober, and faith is drunk before the dawn

I took the cup. The city did not vanish.
But I saw it clearly for the first time before the dawn

Not as something to be saved by fire or gods returned,
But by hands that choose mercy when none demands it before the dawn

When the dragon descended, I did not raise a blade,
I raised the cup, empty now, yet shining before the dawn

Aurelion laughed, a sound like mountains breaking,
Until he tasted the silence I offered before the dawn

No spell bound him. No spear struck true.
He simply remembered what he once guarded before the dawn

Dragons were not made to rule ashes, the cupbearer whispered,
But to circle the fragile and keep watch before the dawn

The dragon lifted, not in defeat, but in sorrow finished,
And the city still stood when light returned before the dawn

At sunrise, the tavern was only a tavern,
The cup only clay, the wine long gone before the dawn

The cupbearer too was gone, leaving a note scratched in ash:
Seek the Beloved in what you protect, not what you conquer before the dawn

Now I keep no ledgers. I watch the gates.
When fear arrives, I pour courage quietly before the dawn

And if this tale bears a name at see its end, let it be mine,
For even Hafren the Watcher learned to love before the dawn
