A Princess of Mars introduces John Carter, a former Confederate cavalry officer who mysteriously finds himself transported from Earth to Mars, known to its inhabitants as Barsoom. Carter is an experienced soldier and adventurer, but nothing in his past prepares him for the strange world he awakens in after an unexplained, near-death experience in an Arizona cave.

Arrival on Barsoom

Carter arrives naked and unarmed on the Martian surface and quickly discovers that Mars has far weaker gravity than Earth. This gives him extraordinary strength, speed, and leaping ability compared to the planet’s native inhabitants. These abilities soon become essential to his survival.

He is captured by the Green Martians, a brutal, nomadic, four-armed warrior race that lives among the ruins of ancient cities. Though technologically advanced in weaponry, they are culturally savage, lacking family structures, compassion, or lasting social bonds. Life among them is governed entirely by strength, custom, and violence.

Despite being a prisoner, Carter earns respect through physical feats and combat prowess. He forms an unlikely friendship with Tars Tarkas, a high-ranking Green Martian who secretly harbors doubts about his people’s cruelty, and gains the loyal companionship of Woola, a fierce but devoted Martian hound.

The Red Martians and Dejah Thoris

Carter’s fortunes change dramatically when a Red Martian airship is attacked by the Green Martians. The ship is destroyed, and its lone survivor, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, is taken captive. Dejah Thoris belongs to the Red Martians, a more civilized, scientifically advanced race descended from the ancient peoples of Mars. Unlike the Green Martians, they live in structured societies, value learning, and work to preserve Mars’s failing atmosphere and dwindling water supply.

Carter immediately recognizes Dejah Thoris as a kindred spirit and risks his standing and life to protect her from abuse. When a Green Martian strikes her during a council meeting, Carter kills the attacker in single combat. This act elevates him to the status of a Green Martian chieftain while also placing him in grave danger, as his loyalty to Dejah Thoris conflicts with Green Martian customs.

Love, Loyalty, and Conflict

As Carter and Dejah Thoris spend time together, a deep bond forms between them. Though constrained by Martian customs and constant surveillance, they share mutual respect, admiration, and growing love. Carter learns that Dejah Thoris has been promised in a political marriage meant to unite rival Red Martian cities, a fate she deeply resists.

Carter becomes increasingly entangled in Martian politics. He witnesses the looming conflict between Helium and its enemy Zodanga, a war that could determine the future of Red Martian civilization. Using his Earth-born ingenuity, combat skills, and Martian-enhanced abilities, Carter helps turn the tide of battle.

War and Resolution

Through daring rescues, arena combat, and battlefield leadership, Carter proves himself not only as a warrior but as a leader capable of uniting divided peoples. He helps Helium defeat Zodanga and prevents the forced marriage of Dejah Thoris, allowing her to choose her own future.

Carter’s actions earn him honor among the Red Martians and bring hope for cooperation between the rival Martian races. He and Dejah Thoris finally acknowledge their love, suggesting a future in which Mars might move beyond endless warfare.

Return to Earth and Legacy

Just as Carter seems poised to begin a new life on Mars, he is abruptly returned to Earth, awakening once more in the Arizona cave where his adventure began. The mechanism of his transportation remains unexplained, reinforcing the novel’s sense of mystery.

Back on Earth, Carter is haunted by longing for Mars and Dejah Thoris. He dedicates himself to finding a way back, believing that his bond with Barsoom is not broken forever. The novel ends on a note of yearning and unresolved destiny, setting the stage for the adventures that follow in later books.

Themes

The novel blends romance, adventure, and early science fiction, exploring themes of honor, cultural relativism, and the contrast between barbarism and civilization. Carter represents the idealized warrior hero, while Mars serves as both a dying world and a mirror reflecting humanity’s own struggles with power, cruelty, and cooperation.
