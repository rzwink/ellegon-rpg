If the party flees without freeing the being, the tower remains unstable and the jewel\u2019s curse persists; allow a heroic turn-back moment. During the escape, failures create detours, lost gear, or separated party members who can reunite quickly\u2014avoid trapping anyone alone for long.",
      "dm_notes": "Make the ritual feel brave and meaningful without any graphic content: explicitly offer kid-safe symbolic substitutes and let players pick what feels comfortable.

Run the escape as 3\u20135 fast beats; each beat asks for one clever idea from the group.

Faint light glows in its upper windows like watchful eyes, and the tower\u2019s garden below looks peaceful in a way that feels\u2026 wrong. Somewhere, a fountain trickles softly, and night-blooming flowers perfume the air as if inviting you closer. Tonight isn\u2019t about fighting or showing off\u2014it\u2019s about a clever, careful heist: slip inside, uncover the truth behind the famous jewel, and end the cruel magic that\u2019s keeping something powerful\u2014and lonely\u2014trapped in the dark."
