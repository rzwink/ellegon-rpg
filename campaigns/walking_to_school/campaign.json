Everything feels ordinary\u2014until the players realize a few tiny details are different today: a porch light still on, an uncollected newspaper, a new flyer on a pole, a friend acting slightly off, or a sound that doesn\u2019t belong. Nothing is dangerous, but the changes invite curiosity and caring. Early choices set the tone: who walks with whom, who gets listened to, and whether anyone slows down to help.",

      "dm_notes": "Keep the tone grounded and warm. Offer 2\u20134 small details and let players choose which matter. If using optional checks, treat them as prompts: noticing reveals feelings or context; kindness checks determine how a gesture is received.

Meanwhile, one small situation appears that needs a decision: a neighbor struggling with grocery bags, a lost dog with a friendly tag, a kid sitting on steps looking upset, a poster that fell and needs re-taping, or a spilled drink that could make someone slip. The group must decide how to help while managing time and feelings. The most important outcome isn\u2019t a perfect fix\u2014it\u2019s the attempt, and doing it together in a respectful way.",

If they choose not to help, show a gentle mirror: someone else helps instead, prompting reflection rather than guilt. If time becomes an issue, let them arrive just as the warning bell rings\u2014still okay, but it adds urgency to wrap up.",
      "dm_notes": "Aim for one central snag and one optional micro-moment. Encourage players to speak in character, but keep scenes short and flowing like a real walk. Reward listening and inclusion with small positive shifts (a friend opens up, someone smiles, a tense mood eases)."

Everything looks normal\u2026 which makes the small differences stand out: a familiar yard that\u2019s slightly wrong, a neighbor who seems stuck with something, a friend who\u2019s quieter than usual, a tiny problem that could turn into a big feeling if nobody notices.
